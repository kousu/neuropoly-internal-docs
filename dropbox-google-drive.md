# Dropbox/Google Drive

This is the organization of each student's folder with Nikola and/or Julien. You can use Dropbox or GDrive, but not both \(to avoid duplication\). Please let us know which one you want to use, then please organize folders as follows:

* **admin** –&gt; administrative stuff such as Polytechnique documents, grades, CV
* **biblio** –&gt; not ALL your biblio, but some interesting stuff that we exchange temporarily
* **conferences** –&gt; subfolder prefix is the date of the event, e.g., **20150530\_ISMRM/**
* **fellowships** –&gt; subfolder prefix is the date of the deadline, e.g., **20150314\_FRQS/**
* **manuscripts** –&gt; subfolder name is year of first submission + journal, e.g., **2015\_neuroimage/**
  * inside folder, organize by revisions, e.g., **r0/**, **r1/**, etc. Then:
    * have a folder **figures/**
    * name your manuscript like: `manuscript_templateSpinalCord_r0_v00.docx`. Once you get feedback from someone, integrates comment and create file: `manuscript_templateSpinalCord_r0_v01.docx`
* **misc** –&gt; anything you want
* **reports** –&gt; include progress reports \(format: google slides, pptx, keynote or pdf\). Google slides are preferred because comments can easily be added. Prefix name should start with AAAAMMDD\_. Example: 20170515\_report.pptx
* **results** –&gt; snapshots/results of your experiments. Prefix should start with AAAAMMDD. Example: **20150120\_dmri\_nogse/**

**NOTE FOR INTERN STUDENTS** You will only need to create folders **admin**, **biblio** and **reports**.

**GENERAL RULES:**

* NEVER USE SPACE OR ACCENTS IN FILE NAMES! \(Unix-unfriendly\).
* Date format should always be YYYYMMDD \(or YYYY-MM-DD\). See this: [https://xkcd.com/1179/](https://xkcd.com/1179/)

P.S. For projects involving multiple students, a “project” folder is created under **GDrive/NeuroPoly/Projects**.
